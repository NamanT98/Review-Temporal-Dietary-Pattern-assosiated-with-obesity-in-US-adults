Obesity is a significant public health concern linked to chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes. Traditional studies have focused on specific dietary actions or nutrients, but considering dietary patterns provides a more comprehensive understanding. Obesity is primarily caused by an imbalance between calorie intake and expenditure, influenced by factors such as consumption of fatty and sugary foods, sedentary work, and lack of supportive policies. Identifying the role of determinants like timing and quantity of eating is important for identifying obesity risk.

In an analysis using NHANES data, the tSNE method was employed for dimensional reduction, and the DBSCAN algorithm was used for clustering. The results revealed four clusters representing temporal dietary patterns. Cluster 2 had the highest number of participants and a higher proportion of obese individuals. Cluster 4 had the lowest BMI and higher physical activity levels, suggesting that increased physical activity may reduce the risk of obesity. Surprisingly, despite having a higher BMI, cluster 2 had lower mean values of total sugar intake, total fat intake, total cholesterol intake, total energy intake, and total food intake compared to clusters 3 and 4. This unexpected result may indicate that obese individuals have reduced their consumption of fatty and sugary foods due to their weight.  Heat maps showed a direct relationship between BMI, waist circumference, and body weight in all clusters.

In conclusion, BMI is closely related to waist circumference and body weight, and physical activity plays a role in reducing the risk of obesity. Factors such as alcohol consumption and dietary cholesterol levels showed minimal correlation with BMI. These findings highlight the importance of considering dietary patterns and multiple determinants when examining the relationship between diet and health.
